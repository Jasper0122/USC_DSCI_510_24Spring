# DSCI 510: Principles of Programming for Data Science - Spring 2023

Welcome to my repository for USC's DSCI 510 course, taught by the esteemed Prof. Jose-Luis Ambite! This course offers an excellent introduction to data science, blending theoretical knowledge with practical application perfectly.

## About This Course

DSCI 510 is an engaging course that serves as a fantastic gateway into the world of data science. The first half of the semester primarily covers the basics of Python programming, laying a solid foundation for computational thinking. As we progress to the second half, the course shifts focus towards the practical aspects of data science such as web scraping, data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using various powerful libraries.

## Final Project

The culmination of this course is a comprehensive project that challenges you to apply all the skills you've learned. Completing this project gives a profound sense of achievement as it involves building a complete data analysis framework from scratch. This project not only solidifies your understanding but also prepares you for real-world data science tasks.

## Why I Recommend This Course

I highly recommend this course for anyone interested in starting their journey in data science. The balance between theory and hands-on experience provided by Prof. Ambite is invaluable. Whether you're a novice or someone with some background in programming, this course will equip you with the necessary tools to handle data effectively.
